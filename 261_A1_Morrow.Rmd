# Connecticut Public Use and Benefit Land Registry File Architecture

This database contains land records held by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), Division of Land Acquisition and Management.  Relevant archived documents for each parcel with a title, lease, or easement held by DEEP have been scanned and stored as PDFs herein.  Each parcel transaction is numbered and contained in a single physical parcel file stored in the Division Archives located at 79 Elm Street, Hartford, CT.  Any physical maps, survey notes, and other documents not relevant to the parcel file or relevant to multiple parcels are stored at the same location in the appropriate repositories.

Notes from the construction of parcels in the Connecticut Public Use and Benefit Land Registry (PUBLR) parcel fabric are included here.
